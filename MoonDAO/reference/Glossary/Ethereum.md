Ethereum is **a decentralized, open-source, and distributed software platform based on blockchain technology**.[^1][^2] It has its own native cryptocurrency called Ether and a programming language called Solidity.[^2] Ethereum enables users to make transactions, earn interest on their holdings through staking, use and store nonfungible tokens (NFTs), trade cryptocurrencies, play games, use social media, and more.[^3] Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is intended to be much more than just a medium of exchange or a store of value.[^4] It is a network of computers all over the world that follow a set of rules called the Ethereum protocol. The Ethereum network acts as the foundation for communities, applications, organizations, and digital assets that anyone can build and use.[^5]
