The Senate meets on a weekly basis to review incoming proposals, please check the calendar on the [MoonDAO Discord server](MoonDAO%20Discord%20server.md) for timing of the meeting. Senate meetings are a forum for the Senate to ask deeper questions about a proposal and conduct due-diligence about the submission.
