Role: [[@Executive]], Operations Lead
Mitchie joined his first project in August 2022 and shortly after committed himself to MoonDAO full-time. Currently serving within the executive branch as operations lead, he's motivated by a nearly-religious conviction in the importance of our shared values and developments at the forefront of space exploration and blockchain innovations. 

Mitchie's background is in graphic/web design, development, and marketing, and has contributed to several projects, including the [current homepage](https://moondao.com/) design. He's committed to supporting the DAO's operations as we collectively navigate the path towards lunar settlement. Mitchie represents the DAO's Canadian presence and speaks intermediate-level French.
