GNSS receivers are most often used for this. However, possible violations of the reception of these signals, as well as cases of their substitution (spoofing) force us to look for alternative options for obtaining the time scale via terrestrial communication channels. One of the solutions is the use of special equipment for the distribution of time signals (ARSV) complete with a time server that receives, stores and transmits time signals to the consumer in any format - NTP, PTP, 1PPS + ToD, etc. The purpose of this article is to present the experience of implementing time-frequency systems using terrestrial communication channels with UTC time scale sources.","author":[{"literal":"A.

  {"id":"AkasakaEtAl2023","abstract":"Synchronized spread spectrum code division multiple access (SS-CDMA) is very effective for increasing the capacity and reducing the interference with a rapid spread of Internet of things (IoT) devices. Since the synchronized SS-CDMA requires receiving timing synchronization, it is essential to realize transmission timing control of each node using space-time synchronization. In this paper, we investigate precise time synchronization between nodes using Wireless Two-Way Interferometry (Wi-Wi). The measurement results show that the standard deviation of offset ($\\sigma$) was less than 30ns. Furthermore, we implement a synchronized SS-CDMA communication function on Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). The bit error rate (BER) characteristics are evaluated with different offsets of initial timing synchronization of the Wi-Wi module. It is found that BER characteristics when two signals are transmitted simultaneously become smaller as the Wi-Wi offset becomes smaller. For an offset of around 12 ns, the degradation of BER compared to the case with 1 transmission signal is negligibly small. As a result, we reveal that simultaneous communication between two terminals is possible without large degradation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Akasaka","given":"Serena"},{"family":"Kameda","given":"Suguru"},{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Shiga","given":"Nobuyasu"}],"citation-key":"AkasakaEtAl2023","DOI":"10.1109/ICUFN57995.2023.10200160","event-place":"Paris, France","event-title":"2023 Fourteenth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,7]]},"language":"en-US","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Paris, France","title":"Implementation and Evaluation of Synchronized SS-CDMA Using Wireless Two-Way Interferometry (Wi-Wi)","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10200160"},
  {"id":"AkasakaEtAl2023a","abstract":"The importance of reliable information transfer in wireless networks, especially regarding communication delay, is drastically increasing to fulfill safe and high-quality communication in the 5G and post-5G era. However, conventional media access control (MAC) protocol for wireless networks, notably Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA), sometimes yields unexpectedly significant delay due to its complex arbitration mechanism assuming asynchronous communication among terminals. As the delay cannot be strictly bounded by a deterministic value, this causes a vulnerability of systems relying on wireless networks. This paper utilizes precise time synchronization achieved by Wireless Two-way Interferometry (Wi-Wi), enabling all terminals to be time-synchronized via wireless signals. We show that by an appropriate periodic assignment of each terminal’s data transmission timing, named Arbitration Point (AP), a simple arbitration algorithm obtains a strictly bounded maximum value for the delay while ensuring equalities among all participants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the total number of terminals manageable in a star-topology wireless network significantly increases by densely packing AP timings, taking into account the spatial geometry information of terminals, which is another feature delivered by Wi-Wi measurement. In the meantime, we experimentally constructed a star-topology wired network where all terminals are time-synchronized via Wi-Wi to confirm the fundamental properties identified in the proposed arbitration protocol. This study paves a new way for future wireless networks where the delay is strictly bounded and provides the basis for ultra-reliable and high-quality information transfer functionalities by utilizing precise time synchronization and space localization (space-time synchronization).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Akasaka","given":"Serena"},{"family":"Kameda","given":"Suguru"},{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Shiga","given":"Nobuyasu"}],"citation-key":"AkasakaEtAl2023a","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3087866","event-place":"Paris, France","event-title":"2023 Fourteenth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks (ICUFN)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,7]]},"language":"en-US","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Paris, France","title":"Delay-Bounded Wireless Network Based on Precise Time Synchronization Using Wireless Two-Way Interferometry","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9449865/?denied="},

For these system, the survival of and operation in the extreme cold of the lunar night will be the biggest challenge, as most will be purely battery driven and unable to rely on radioisotope heaters. Maximizing battery lifetime in these conditions requires a trade-off between energy density, low-temperature performance and insulation, but comparable temperature and current dependent discharge capacities of batteries and other energy storage devices are often not reported in datasheets or literature. For this reason, a selection of energy storage devices was chosen and tested to determine their low-temperature performance in a representative environment. Based on this data, the theoretical lifetime per battery weight and optimal operational temperature for varying degrees of insulation was determined. It was shown that the selection of the optimal energy storage device and operational temperature depends on the insulation, emphasizing the need for multi-disciplinary design optimization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Biswas","given":"János"},{"family":"Malzone","given":"Pietro Queiroga"},{"family":"Rößler","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"BiswasEtAl2021","container-title":"Acta Astronautica","container-title-short":"Acta Astronautica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.04.042","ISSN":"0094-5765","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"308-318","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Energy storage selection and operation for night-time survival of small lunar surface systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576521002101","volume":"185"},

This paper deals with DTN communication from Moon to Earth, based on the use of a lunar satellite acting as a “data-mule” to collect data from a Lander located on the far side of the Moon. To make the scenario more interesting and complex from the point of view of possible security threats, we assume that data must be transferred to a non-institutional user connected to the Space Agency Control Centre via Internet. In particular, the paper investigates the state-of-the-art ability of ION, the NASA implementation of the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP), to cope with the many challenges of the space scenario under investigation, such as intermittent links, low bandwidth, relatively high delays, network partitioning, DTN routing, interoperability between LTP and TCP BP Convergence layers and security threats. To this end, the first part of the paper contains three brief overviews of the DTN architecture, the Bundle Security Protocol and the ION implementation.

  {"id":"ChinEtAl2008","abstract":"The initial creation of the P-POD was driven by the need for consistency and increased frequency in both pico-satellite development and access to space. The PPOD protects the launch vehicle and the primary payload as well as the CubeSats, and is compatible with many launch vehicles, making integration repeatable and cost-efficient. The P-POD can accommodate picosatellites that meet the 1kg mass and 10 centimeter cubic dimensional CubeSat standard. Mass producing a stock deployment device creates reliability in flight heritage and decreases design, manufacturing and testing costs. The P-POD provides a framework for developers to design around, and enforces adherence to the CubeSat specification. In turn, the P-POD is designed with the capability to integrate onto multiple launch vehicles. The advantages of this system are most evident in creating flexibility for CubeSat developers to launch on multiple rockets as secondary payloads. Since most satellite manufacturers must coordinate directly with the launch vehicle provider, secondary and tertiary payloads find it difficult to acquire launches. The P-POD can group multiple CubeSats to provide a competitive basis for launch as a viable secondary payload. This has allowed CubeSat developers to develop their system without a preset launch. A review of the P-POD flights over the past 5 years, and an outline of future launches consistently show the value of a standard and the benefits of flexibility.","author":[{"family":"Chin","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Coelho","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Brooks","given":"Lori"},{"family":"Nugent","given":"Ryan"}],"citation-key":"ChinEtAl2008","event-place":"Los Angeles, CA","event-title":"6th Responsive Space Conference","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"language":"en","publisher":"AIAA","publisher-place":"Los Angeles, CA","source":"Zotero","title":"Standardization Promotes Flexibility: A Review of CubeSats’ Success","type":"paper-conference"},

Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based software that provides an ABM analysis platform with minimal code complexity. We compare our software with some of the most popular ABM software in other programming languages.

Agents.jl also integrates excellently with the entire Julia ecosystem, including interactive applications, differential equations, parameter optimization, and so on.

  {"id":"DivsalarEtAl2019","abstract":"In this paper we design and analyze an end-to-end communication system between a lander/rover on the surface of the lunar South Pole and an Earth station. The acquisition and tracking system is discussed in detail. The communication system on the lander or rover could be used for the Earth-to-Moon communication. To communicate to and from the lander/rover on the lunar South Pole, low and/or medium directional antennas onboard the lander/rover will have to be pointed at low elevation angles between 2 to 10 degrees, thus causing multipath fading effects due to reflection of a portion of the transmitted electromagnetic waves from the surface of the Moon that are not commonly encountered in traditional deep space communications between a spacecraft and a ground station. To design and analyze such a communication system, and in particular the acquisition and tracking system, in the presence of multipath fading, first we model the fading channel based on existing and simulated data. In addition to multipath fading, the channel also introduces Doppler frequency up to 11.5 KHz, and Doppler rate up to 0.735 Hz/sec. For coherent reception the Doppler frequency, which is time varying, should be acquired and the incoming carrier phase, which includes the fading phase, should be tracked in the presence of multipath fading. For this communication system in addition to estimating the received carrier phase, the amplitude of the fading signal should also be estimated, in particular to be used in the decoder. In addition to acquisition and tracking, we consider simple modulation and coding schemes. Space diversity using two antennas on Earth to mitigate the effects of fading could also be used. We design phase-locked loops and frequency sweeping schemes robust to the attenuations due to fading. After designing various components of the communication system, we use Simulink models to obtain the end-to-end performance of the communication link under investigation. Based on the available data, the fading channel can be accurately modeled as a Rician fading channel with Rician parameter of 10 dB, and Doppler spread that depends on the Doppler frequency and the transmit/receive antenna patterns. The challenge is how to make such a communication system robust in the presence of the multipath fading where the Doppler spread changes in time and thus produces fading with time-varying durations (short and very long fades). In summary, this paper covers communication system design, performance analysis, and simulations for performance of Doppler frequency acquisition, tracking, uncoded system, and coded system under ideal interleaving assumption with hard decision over communication link between a lander/rover at the Lunar south pole and a DSN Earth station in presence of Rician fading.","author":[{"family":"Divsalar","given":"Dariush"},{"family":"Net","given":"Marc Sanchez"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Kar-Ming"}],"citation-key":"DivsalarEtAl2019","container-title":"2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference","DOI":"10.1109/AERO.2019.8742112","event-title":"2019 IEEE Aerospace Conference","ISSN":"1095-323X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3]]},"page":"1-14","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Acquisition and tracking for communications between Lunar South Pole and Earth","type":"paper-conference"},

In Part I, we discussed SmallSat direct-to-earth links and SmallSat communications equipment, and provided recommendations for future work. In Part II, we focus on SmallSat navigation options, Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN), proximity links, and the use of the communication link for science observations, and we provide recommendations for future work. We have examined both radio and optical navigation options, and considered autonomous and semiautonomous navigation to reduce operational costs for planetary SmallSats. We note that communication link resilience to delay and disruption enhances spacecraft autonomy; therefore, we have provided a discussion of DTN to indicate that using DTN allows for automated data transmission and recovery, therefore, reducing manual operations. SmallSats in deep space may utilize a relay spacecraft for communications with earth or function as a relay for landed and in-orbit assets. We present a detailed examination of relay proximity links and networks where we address both proximity hardware and networking scenarios. The proximity link features that we examine include the network architecture and its relationship to DTN, proximity radios and antennas, communications link performance, and proximity navigation. The use of the communication link for science has been practiced by primary missions in deep space scenarios.

This article provides a brief introduction to radio science and presents the prerequisite features necessary for radio science observations by SmallSats. We conclude with nine recommendations based on the findings of the study. These recommendations are guidelines on the design, implementation, and operation of deep space SmallSat communication links. The adoption of some or all of the guidelines should result in an enhanced communication and tracking capability for the deep space SmallSat missions.","author":[{"literal":"Faramaz Davarian"},{"family":"Davarian","given":"F."},{"literal":"Sami Asmar"},{"family":"Asmar","given":"Sami W."},{"family":"Angert","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Baker","given":"John"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Hodges","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Israel","given":"David J."},{"family":"Landau","given":"Damon"},{"family":"Lay","given":"Norman"},{"literal":"Leigh Torgerson"},{"family":"Torgerson","given":"Leigh"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"FaramazDavarianEtAl2020","container-title":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","DOI":"10.1109/maes.2020.2975260","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,1]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3038700175\nS2ID: 89870129e3096c6c583752ce26de60b0d44148d6","page":"26-40","title":"Improving Small Satellite Communications and Tracking in Deep Space—A Review of the Existing Systems and Technologies With Recommendations for Improvement.

  {"id":"FaramazDavarianEtAl2020a","abstract":"Robotic exploration of the solar system using small satellites (SmallSats) is gaining popularity because of SmallSats’ lower cost and faster development cycle compared to primary science missions. A potential obstacle for deployment of SmallSats in deep space is the limitation associated with the communications link imposed by SmallSats' frugal power and antenna size. These technical limitations constrain the range and throughput of SmallSats and may impact their navigation performance. To allow SmallSats to play a greater role in deep space science endeavors, we propose an enhanced communications architecture that will lessen the communications disparity between larger, more expensive missions and SmallSats. The objectives of the study are to define a communications architecture, in-flight and flight-to-ground, that is needed for planetary SmallSats, both standalone or in support of a larger mission; and to develop a guideline for primary spacecraft that would communicate with ride-along SmallSats. This work treats the space segment and the ground network as a whole to provide for improvements not only via investments in technology, but also via improvements in operational procedures. The study includes reviews of current communication concepts, technologies, and procedures, as well as an assessment of navigation needs, evaluation of the communication architecture performance for a range of destinations and applications, and identification of any gaps in capability. The study product is a set of recommendations to space agencies and the planetary SmallSat community. The main thrust of these recommendations is investment in technology, such as radios, antennas, protocols, and methodologies. The concepts for improving communications capability of deep space SmallSats are discussed in a series of three articles, Improving Small Satellite Communications in Deep Space.

The Helium network is a decentralized machine network that enables machines anywhere in the world to wirelessly connect to the Internet and geolocate themselves without the need for power-hungry satellite location hardware or expensive cellular plans. Powering the Helium network is a blockchain with a native protocol token incentivizing a twosided marketplace between coverage providers and coverage consumers. With the introduction of a blockchain, we inject decentralization into an industry currently controlled by monopolies. The result is that wireless network coverage becomes a commodity, fueled by competition, available anywhere in the world, at a fraction of current costs.

  {"id":"HarleEtAl","abstract":"View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2021-4132.vidLunar comms and nav infrastructure – first data relay orbiter Lunar Pathfinder, operational in 2024, paves the way for full constellation by 2030s A key to sustainable lunar exploration is access to permanent, low-cost and high performance service infrastructure. Easy access to support services such as communication and navigation will rapidly become essential for lunar missions, for technical and economic reasons. A similar trend has already been observed in the transportation domain in the USA, where 14 CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) compete regularly to provide transportation to the Moon as a service. To an emerging space nation with a low-budget science mission on the far-side, this infrastructure will be an enabler by removing the need for a relay spacecraft. To a commercial endeavour looking to invest in ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization), it will help close the business case for investment and grow the demand. Early 2021, in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA), Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) started the clock on the development of Lunar Pathfinder, the first data-relay lunar orbiter to commercially offer communication services to missions on the surface and in orbit around the Moon. From 2024 onwards, lunar missions of all types (orbiters, rovers, landers, stationary instruments) will be able to access the service and dramatically enhance the value of their mission by lifting the multiple constraints of transferring data back to Earth. Transmitting Direct to Earth (DTE) presents several limitations that can be lifted by the use of a comms relay infrastructure. DTE relies on direct line of sight, which makes it impossible for far-side missions, and a risk for mobile missions likely to encounter obstructing terrain. It also limits the achievable data-rate and contact time with the often oversubscribed deep space ground stations, therefore constraining the overall volume of data that can be retrieved by the end user. With a store and forward capability, a proximity link, two simultaneous channels in S-band and UHF, Lunar Pathfinder data-relay spacecraft is designed to lift these constraints, allowing longer upload durations at higher data-rates with each of the lunar assets, and bulk-sending data, at high speed, back to an Earth Ground Station, ready for distribution to the end users. In addition to its main mission, Lunar Pathfinder will also carry a hosted payload, an ESA GNSS receiver, with the objective of running a GNSS weak signal detection experiment from lunar orbit, a significant step towards navigation service provision for lunar assets. The decision to proceed with building the Lunar Pathfinder infrastructure and services, in the frame of a commercial partnership between SSTL and ESA, was the result of a successful study phase realized for ESA in collaboration with Goonhilly Earth Station (GES). It was also enabled by NASA’s interest in using the communication services for their own robotic assets. Several customer missions are now actively working with SSTL Lunar (a new brand of SSTL, dedicated to the provision of lunar services) to prepare their communication service package. And we are not stopping there… As lunar missions evolve and move from mainly science and exploration towards in-situ resource utilization and purely commercial endeavours, such as tourism, they will increasingly rely on a lunar infrastructure that can provide permanent, low-cost and high performance key support services. Building upon the Lunar Pathfinder experience and the commercialisation of its services, an SSTL-led consortium, including established telecom operators, as well as space and ground segment integrators, is already working on the next generation infrastructure. With a space segment based on a constellation of data-relay orbiters and strong interoperability requirements with other infrastructure elements such as Gateway, the overall system will integrate into the backbone infrastructure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Harle","given":"Nelly Offord"},{"family":"Oates","given":"Clive"},{"family":"Bywater","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Cranstoun","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Friend","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Lay","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Schwarz","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Hufenbach","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Liuicci","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Cosby","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Saunders","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"HarleEtAl","container-title":"ASCEND 2021","DOI":"10.2514/6.2021-4132","publisher":"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","source":"American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","title":"Lunar comms and nav infrastructure – first data relay orbiter Lunar Pathfinder, operational in 2024, paves the way for full constellation by 2030s","type":"chapter","URL":"https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2021-4132"},

The data is vulnerable to attack due to the nature of the systems, so maintaining confidentiality is an important problem. Most security methods are based on common or public key cryptosystems. However, these methods have problems with encryption of data. When nodes try to encrypt data, they must preestablish keys. When nodes send data to the sink node, all of the exchanged information will concentrate in the sink node. This creates a single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a new distribution method resilient against node capture attacks using the secret sharing scheme. In addition, we will confirm the ability of our method to improve resiliency against node capture attacks, comparing it with TinySec, which is the major security architecture of wireless sensor networks. Also, we compare the resiliency to existing pairwise key establishment methods.","author":[{"family":"Kohno","given":"Eitaro"},{"family":"Ohta","given":"Tomoyuki"},{"family":"Kakuda","given":"Yoshiaki"}],"citation-key":"KohnoEtAl2009","container-title":"2009 International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems","DOI":"10.1109/ISADS.2009.5207366","event-title":"2009 International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems","ISSN":"1541-0056","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3]]},"page":"1-6","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Secure decentralized data transfer against node capture attacks for wireless sensor networks","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"KoyamaEtAl2021","abstract":"The growing demand of high-bandwidth and low-latency information transfer in information and communication technologies such as data centers and in-vehicle networks has increased the importance of optical communication networks in recent years. However, complicated arbitration schemes can impose significant overheads in data transfer, which may inhibit the full exploitation of the potential of optical interconnects. Herein, we propose an arbitration protocol based on precision time synchronization via wireless two-way interferometry (Wi-Wi), and numerically validate its efficiency including the ability to impose a strict upper bound on the latency of data transfer. We introduce the notion of arbitration point (AP) for a designated time duration, which is shared by all nodes thanks to the time synchronization by Wi-Wi, to determine data transmission while ensuring avoiding collision. Compared with the conventional carrier sense multiple access/collision detection (CSMA/CD)-based approach, a significant improvement in the data transfer was observed especially in the cases with high traffic flow rate. Furthermore, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment for Wi-Wi-based data transfer between two electrically connected nodes and confirmed that the skew was less than 300 ns and remained stable over time. Conversely, non-Wi-Wi-based data transfer exhibited huge and unstable skew. These results indicate that precision time synchronization is a promising resource to reduce the communication overheads and ensure low latency for future networks and real-time applications.","author":[{"family":"Koyama","given":"Daijiro"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yunzhuo"},{"family":"Shiga","given":"Nobuyasu"},{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Chauvet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Naruse","given":"Makoto"}],"citation-key":"KoyamaEtAl2021","container-title":"Nonlinear Theory and Its Applications, IEICE","DOI":"10.1587/nolta.12.225","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"225-235","source":"J-Stage","title":"Low latency information transfer based on precision time synchronization via wireless interferometry","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"LawEtAl2021","abstract":"The Line of Sight (LoS) is one of the latest tools to join the analytics suite of tools for the Solar System Treks (https://trek.nasa.gov) portals.  The LoS tool provides a way to compute visibility between the entities in our solar system. More concretely, this utility searches for windows of communication or a “line of sight” between any two entities. Entities include orbiters, rovers, planetary bodies, ground stations, and other topographical locations. In addition to establishing communications between the two entities, the tool also takes into account local terrains of the entities in question.\n\nThe software seeks to answer questions about establishing communications between a rover and an orbiter, or an orbiter to a ground station. In mission planning, LoS can be used to determine possible traverses for a rover that must maintain communications with a lander, or find time intervals of communication to an orbiter when a rover or lander are near an obstructing surface feature such as a crater rim or mound. Computations can be even more granular and lines of sight can be computed between mission instruments, thus allowing to ask questions such as “Is the High Gain Antenna on a rover visible from an orbiter?”\n\nThe initial release of the software focuses on the lunar surface and the LRO spacecraft. Users can ask whether a topographical location on the moon is visible from the orbiter or a discrete set of ground stations on Earth. The tool uses NAIF SPICE and various mission kernels for computing planetary geometries. LoS also uses high resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to model the terrain surrounding the points of interest. In-house software is used to convert high resolution DEMs into a format compatible with the tool. Users can provide their own DEMs to model the terrain on different topographical locations to use for their own computations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Law","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Gallegos","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Malhotra","given":"Shan"}],"citation-key":"LawEtAl2021","DOI":"10.5194/epsc2021-150","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,28]]},"language":"en","number":"EPSC2021-150","publisher":"Copernicus Meetings","source":"meetingorganizer.copernicus.org","title":"Line of Sight Analysis","type":"report","URL":"https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EPSC2021/EPSC2021-150.html"},
  {"id":"LindenEtAl2023","abstract":"The establishment of a local lunar time standard or a shared and openly accessible reference timing signal can greatly enhance the positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities of lunar missions without the need for direct links to Earth or precision instruments to be a requirement for every mission to the Moon. This paper proposes the concept of a local lunar time standard that can be accessed using technology that is likely to be included in most lunar missions for nominal activities. Even if the local lunar time standard exhibits drift or variations from terrestrial time, its existence would be a significant step towards lunar coordination. Unlike terrestrial synchronized time, a fully usable lunar reference time can be implemented proactively before the activity that necessitates it occurs. This paper discusses the potential benefits and challenges of establishing a local lunar time standard and its implications for lunar missions, including its compatibility with existing lunar initiatives such as LunaNet, Moonlight, and upcoming lunar missions. The proposal highlights the opportunities and considerations for stakeholders in the cislunar ecosystem, including options for missions to ignore, participate in seeding, or consume the proposed timekeeping protocol. The proposal is expected to contribute to the evolving landscape of timekeeping technologies and methods in cislunar space, and stimulate further research and discussion on this topic.","author":[{"family":"Linden","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Jardine","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Schingler","given":"Jessy Kate"}],"citation-key":"LindenEtAl2023","DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.2.29175.70564","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,1]]},"license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC-BY-SA)","publisher":"Open Lunar Foundation","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Possibilities for a Local Lunar Time Standard","type":"report"},

As a result, numerous and very different missions to the Moon are currently being studied and implemented, assuming to have our satellite quite crowded soon. Such a scenario motivates the settling of space infrastructures to offer recurrent services like data relays, communication links and navigation in the cislunar environment which would facilitate and enlighten the single mission’s implementation and operation. The paper presents the strategy adopted to address the design of the orbital configuration for a distributed architecture to answer the communication and navigation needs to serve at the best the diversified lunar missions scenario expected for the next decades. First, a set of parameters of merit are identified and explained in their mathematical expression and physical meaning. Then, different regions of interest for possible future missions are identified and mapped to the relevant performances wanted for that specific region. Last a Multi-Objective Optimisation framework is presented, both in the exploited genotype and the different objectives participating to the definition of the cost function, in order to provide a versatile tool. The paper critically discusses the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting the best suited distributed orbital architectures for the servicers according to the expected service performance in specific user regions, spread all over the Earth–Moon volume — from Earth vicinity to Lunar surface, considering also robustness aspects. The benefits in the exploitation of the multibody dynamical regime offered by the Earth–Moon system to set up the most promising orbital set with a minimum number of servicing spacecraft are underlined as well.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasquale","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Zanotti","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Prinetto","given":"Jacopo"},{"family":"Ceresoli","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Lavagna","given":"Michèle"}],"citation-key":"PasqualeEtAl2022","container-title":"Acta Astronautica","container-title-short":"Acta Astronautica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actaastro.2022.06.004","ISSN":"0094-5765","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"345-354","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Cislunar distributed architectures for communication and navigation services of lunar assets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576522002831","volume":"199"},

Dozens of lunar missions are planned for the coming decade which will require the development of a sustainable communication infrastructure with high data rates and minimal latency. Space communication systems thus far have relied on Radio Frequency (RF) links alone, but recent developments in laser communications have demonstrated that Free Space Optical (FSO) links can achieve much higher data rates. Upon considering the respective benefits and drawbacks of RF and FSO links, we make a case for the integration of these two technologies into a hybrid RF/FSO lunar communications architecture which leverages small satellites in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation. We include a case study for this technology designed in Analytical Graphics' Systems Tool Kit (STK) software. Results are presented in terms of chain access duration, propagation delay, transmission loss, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Bit Error Rate (BER).

The most of energy consumption occurs due to transmission of messages, such as data and control packets. In our new approach clustering and multi hop routing algorithms are performing at the same stage to decrease control packets. According to non-uniform energy consumption among nodes, clusters are formed in such a way that cluster heads have the most competency in forwarding task of intra-cluster and inter-cluster transmission tree.

Since the synchronized SS-CDMA requires receiving timing synchronization, it is essential to realize transmission timing control of each node using space-time synchronization. In this paper, we investigate precise time synchronization between nodes using Wireless Two-Way Interferometry (Wi-Wi). The measurement results show that the standard deviation of offset ($\\sigma$) was less than 30ns. Furthermore, we implement a synchronized SS-CDMA communication function on Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP). The bit error rate (BER) characteristics are evaluated with different offsets of initial timing synchronization of the Wi-Wi module. It is found that BER characteristics when two signals are transmitted simultaneously become smaller as the Wi-Wi offset becomes smaller. For an offset of around 12 ns, the degradation of BER compared to the case with 1 transmission signal is negligibly small. As a result, we reveal that simultaneous communication between two terminals is possible without large degradation.","author":[{"literal":"Serena Akasaka"},{"literal":"Suguru Kameda"},{"literal":"S.

Due to the importance of long-term continued monitoring of the variations of the Earth’s gravitational field and the limited lifetime of GRACE, a follow-on mission is currently planned to be launched in 2017. In order to minimise risk and the time to launch, the follow-on mission will be basically a rebuild of GRACE with microwave ranging as the primary instrument for measuring changes of the intersatellite distance. Laser interferometry has been proposed as a method to achieve improved ranging precision for future GRACE-like missions and is therefore foreseen to be included as demonstrator experiment in the follow-on mission now under development.

  {"id":"ShigaEtAl2017","abstract":"Wireless two-way interferometry (Wi-Wi) is the simplified version of “carrier phase based two-way satellite time and frequency transfer,” wherein a wireless communication technology is used instead of a satellite communication technology. We used the carrier phase of a 2.4 GHz ZigBee module to measure the variation of two rubidium clocks at remote sites. Since clocks in the ZigBee module are much less precise than rubidium clocks, the carrier phase of the ZigBee signal cannot be used to compare two rubidium clocks in a simple manner. Using a technique to cancel the clock error of transmitters, we demonstrated picosecond-level precision measurement of the time variation of clocks between two remote systems. This synchronization technique at picosecond-level precision opens the door to low-cost wireless positioning at millimeter accuracy.","author":[{"family":"Shiga","given":"Nobuyasu"},{"family":"Kido","given":"Kohta"},{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Panta","given":"Bhola"},{"family":"Hanado","given":"Yuko"},{"family":"Kawamura","given":"Seiji"},{"family":"Hanado","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Takizawa","given":"Kenichi"},{"family":"Inoue","given":"Masugi"}],"citation-key":"ShigaEtAl2017","container-title":"IEICE Communications Express","DOI":"10.1587/comex.2016xbl0181","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"page":"77-82","source":"J-Stage","title":"Demonstration of wireless two-way interferometry (Wi-Wi)","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"ShourabouraEtAl","abstract":"NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN) is a unique facility responsible for communication and navigation support for over forty NASA and international space missions. For many years, demand on the network has been greater than its capacity, and so a collaborative negotiation process has been developed among the network’s users to resolve contention and come to agreement on the schedule. This process has become strained by increasing demand, to the point that oversubscription is routinely as high as 40% over actual capacity. As a result, DSN has started investigating the possibility of moving to some kind of prioritization scheme to allow for more automated and timely resolution of network contention. Other NASA networks have used strict static mission priorities, but if this were applied in the same way to the DSN, some missions would fall out of the schedule altogether. In this paper we report on analysis and experimentation with several approaches to DSN prioritization. Our objectives include preserving as much of each each mission’s requested contact time as possible, while allowing them to identify which of their specific scheduling requests are of greatest importance to them. We have obtained the most promising results with a variant of Squeaky Wheel Optimization combined with limiting each mission’s input based on historical negotiated reduction levels.","author":[{"family":"Shouraboura","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Johnston","given":"Mark D"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"ShourabouraEtAl","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Prioritization and Oversubscribed Scheduling for NASA’s Deep Space Network","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"TanakaEtAl2022","abstract":"Low latency and reliable information transfer are highly demanded in fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G wireless communications. A novel delay-bounded wireless media access control (MAC) protocol called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Arbitration Point (CSMA/AP) was established to strictly ensure the upper boundary of communication delay. CSMA/AP enables collision-free and delay-bounded communications with a simple arbitration mechanism exploiting the precise time synchronization achieved by Wireless Two-Way Interferometry (Wi-Wi). Experimental demonstration and proving the feasibility in wireless environments are among the most critical steps before any further discussion of CSMA/AP and extension to various applications can take in place. In this work described in this paper, we experimentally demonstrated the fundamental principles of CSMA/AP by constructing a star-topology wireless network using software-defined radio terminals combined with precise time synchronization devices. We show that CSMA/AP was successfully operated, even with dynamic changes of the spatial position of the terminal or the capability to accommodate mobility, thanks to the real-time adaption to the dynamically changing environment by Wi-Wi. We also experimentally confirmed that the proposed CSMA/AP principle cannot be executed without Wi-Wi, which validates the importance of precise time synchronization. This study paves the way toward realizing delay-bounded wireless communications for future low-latency and highly reliable critical applications.","author":[{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Haruaki"},{"family":"Yamasaki","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Shiga","given":"Nobuyasu"},{"family":"Takizawa","given":"Kenichi"},{"family":"Chauvet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Horisaki","given":"Ryoichi"},{"family":"Naruse","given":"Makoto"}],"citation-key":"TanakaEtAl2022","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3203997","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"page":"94285-94297","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Experimental Demonstration of Delay-Bounded Wireless Network Based on Precise Time Synchronization","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"VelazcoEtAl","abstract":"JPL is developing a new omnidirectional optical terminal that will provide fast communications and accurate navigation for swarms of spacecraft. The omnidirectional optical communicator/navigator (OOCN) under development presents a truncated icosahedral geometry that contains arrays of miniature laser telescopes and optical detectors. The miniature optical telescopes are located at the center of each OOCN facet and allow for full sky coverage. The optical detectors, symmetrically deployed on each vertex of the OOCN body, have two purposes: to receive fast incoming communications signals and accurately determine the angle of arrival (AOA) of the incoming signal. The continuous AOA tracking performed by the OOCN mechanism makes it ideally suited for swarm navigation as well. In this paper, we provide a general description of the main OOCN features: 1) high data rate communications, 2) full sky coverage, and 3) ability to maintain multiple links simultaneously. The current OOCN prototype operates at a wavelength of 650 nm, and uses low-power single-mode laser diodes and fast silicon photodetectors. We present the latest experimental results of AOA and pointing testing obtained with this prototype in our optical laboratory.

Such platforms are being used for several space applications, such as education, Earth remote sensing, science, and defense. As of May 31st, 2018, 855 CubeSats had been launched. Remote sensing application is the main sector in which CubeSats are being used, corresponding to about 45% of all applications. This fact indicates the commercial potential of such a platform. Fifty eight countries have already been involved with developing CubeSats. The most used CubeSat configuration is 3U (about 64%), followed by 1U (18%), while 6U platforms account for about 4%. In this paper, we present an analysis of the current situation regarding CubeSats worldwide, through the use of a dataset built to encompass information about these satellites. The overall success rate of the CubeSat missions is increasing over time. Moreover, considering CubeSat missions as a Bernoulli experiment, and excluding launch failures, the current success rate was estimated, as a parameter of a binomial distribution, to be about 75%. By using a logistic model and considering that the launchings keep following the current tendency, one can expect that one thousand CubeSats will be launched in 2021, within 95% certainty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2023,2,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Villela","given":"Thyrso"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Cesar A."},{"family":"Brandão","given":"Alessandra M."},{"family":"Bueno","given":"Fernando T."},{"family":"Leonardi","given":"Rodrigo"}],"citation-key":"VillelaEtAl2019","container-title":"International Journal of Aerospace Engineering","container-title-short":"International Journal of Aerospace Engineering","DOI":"10.1155/2019/5063145","ISSN":"1687-5966, 1687-5974","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,10]]},"language":"en","page":"1-13","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Towards the Thousandth CubeSat: A Statistical Overview","title-short":"Towards the Thousandth CubeSat","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijae/2019/5063145/","volume":"2019"},
