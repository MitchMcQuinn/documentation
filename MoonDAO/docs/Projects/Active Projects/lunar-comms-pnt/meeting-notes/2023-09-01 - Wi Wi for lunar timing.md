transport/dissemination -- wiwi
timekeeping -- open time card as reference

wiwi -> communication device becomes the sync+ranging device if both ends have a stable&precise clock

if you can talk to someone, you can sync and find distance to them as long as both sides have a stable clock and using wiwi
	this leads to decentralization... you don't need to have a-priori knowledge or intent to coop but you can anyway

apply stratum concept here

maintain a channel of communication to make pseudo entanglement

stratum 0 is always UTC stratum 0 (on earth)
stratum 1 is less precise than stratum 0
gps is stratum 2
