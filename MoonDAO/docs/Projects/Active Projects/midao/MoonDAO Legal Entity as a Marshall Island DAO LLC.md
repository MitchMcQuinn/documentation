**Abstract**: *MoonDAO as an entity has rights and can take actions as an entity. It can own land, hire contractors and own IP. However, to exercise most of these rights, it needs to be legally recognized as a legal entity and have a bank account. This proposal would formally establish MoonDAO as a legal entity based in the Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) as a Nonprofit DAO LLC. The RMI entity would also simplify MoonDAO’s tax obligations as outlined below.* 

For context on what a nonprofit is, the IRS defines nonprofits as “organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, educational or other specified purposes.” The IRS also provides favorable tax treatment for “social welfare organizations, civic leagues, social clubs, labor organizations and business leagues.” 

Motivation: The reason why RMI is the best option for MoonDAO is because this legal entity is compatible with tracking our members and our votes on the blockchain. Considering that our token is a [governance token](Governance%20Tokens.md) and we do not issue any returns or dividends to members, the nonprofit entity is the most ideal structure (See this article for more in depth analysis of the benefits of RMI legal entity). MoonDAO needs to have a proper legal entity if we plan on taking on bigger projects that may require us to make big purchases, enter into formal contracts and acquire a physical headquarters/working space. 

Specification: The main goal is to go through [MIDAO](MIDAO.md) to establish this entity. It will require [@pmoncada](@pmoncada.md) to do KYC. The legal documents that establish us as a RMI Nonprofit DAO Llc will be similar to these and we will be able to adjust it as necessary:

Once the final governing documents are finalized, MoonDAO will vote once more for final approval. 

Benefits: Legal recognition for our community among the international community. This legal entity will further establish us as a professional organization that is here to stay. It will also provide legal protection to our members from legal liability issues. This will also allow our community to legally own assets as decided by the community. 

Risks: There are minimal risks. The application could be denied (albeit unlikely), in which case we’d receive a full refund from [MIDAO](MIDAO.md).

Objectives and Key Results: 

Objective #1: Have our application to become a legal entity be approved. Key Results for Objective #1: 

- Submit the application through [MIDAO](MIDAO.md).org and provide the requisite paperwork - Have three members submit the requisite applications to go through KYC process. - Follow up with [MIDAO](MIDAO.md) on finalizing application.
