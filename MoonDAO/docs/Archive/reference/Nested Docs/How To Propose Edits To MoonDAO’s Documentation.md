This guide will walk you through the process of submitting edits to MoonDAO’s official docs. Before proceeding, [create a Github account](https://github.com/), and install both [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download). We’ll use Obsidian as our editor and Github Desktop for syncing and submitting the edits.  
  
## Step One: Setup  

**A.** [Follow this link](https://github.com/Official-MoonDao/moondaowww/fork) and click “FORK”. This makes a copy of all the information contained in the docs which is controlled by your account. This is called a repository or 'repo'.  

**B.** In your copied repo, click the green button labeled “Code” and select “Download ZIP”. Once the file is downloaded, you can extract the files to a local folder of your choice.  
  
## Step Two: Edit

**A.** Open Obsidian, select the “Open Folder As Vault” option and, within the folder you just extracted the files to, select the ‘moondao-vault’ folder.  

**B.** In the left sidebar in Obsidian, navigate to the nested ‘docs’ folder folder and click the file to edit.  

**C.** Make changes to the file within the text editor. If you intend to include the page as an internal link (ie. not listed in the top navigation menu of the docs) then drag the page somewhere within the nested “Archive” folder.  
  
## Step Three: Publish

**A.** Open Github Desktop and navigate to File>Add Local Repository… and then select the 'moondao-valut' folder. To make sure you're always working with the latest version, click the "Fetch Origin" button in Github Desktop before making any edits in Obsidian.

**B.** In Github Desktop, you'll see a checklist of the changes you've made and, in the bottom left, title and description fields above a "Commit to Main" button. Make sure the changes you wish to finalize are selected, write in a title and optional description of the change, and then click the button. 

**C.** Finally, simply click the "Push Origin" button that will appear in the main window. Once accepted by a member of our team, the changes will be reflected within the official docs.
