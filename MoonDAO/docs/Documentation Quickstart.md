MoonDAO's documentation, planning, project notes, and other reference material is organized in an [Obsidian vault](<[Obsidian vault](https://help.obsidian.md/Home)>). This vault is the source data for [docs.moondao.com](https://docs.moondao.com) through [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish). As an Obsidian vault, all documentation is saved as plain-text files styled with [a flavor of Markdown syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Obsidian+Flavored+Markdown).

The source files for [docs.moondao.com](https://docs.moondao.com) and other archived documentation are publicly available at [github.com/Official-MoonDao/moondao-vault](https://github.com/Official-MoonDao/moondao-vault).

## Keeping your vault up to date
The [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) plugin streamlines automatic commits and syncing to the remote branch.
The vault must be set up as a git repository to use this plugin. If you cloned or forked the repo from GitHub, you're all set.

Nearly all the regular git practices have corresponding commands in Obsidian from the plugin. Pull changes from the main branch with Command Palette â†’ `Obsidian Git: Pull`.
# Contributing to the docs
The documentation vault and website are decoupled. Changes to the vault's source files only propagate to the site through a manual Publish step.
## Submitting changes to the vault
The `main` branch is protected. All changes must be submitted as [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Official-MoonDao/moondao-vault/pulls) into `main`.
