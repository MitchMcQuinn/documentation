> We demonstrated a new method to monitor tilt of a 60 m steel tower with millimeter precision, based on Wireless two Way interferometry technique (Wi-Wi). The result is consistent with the results from a laser range finder. We then developed a compact module to realize Wi-Wi for non-destructive infrastructure monitoring. We expect this technique to be useful to assess infrastructural health and provide early warning in case of the need for repair, replacement.
