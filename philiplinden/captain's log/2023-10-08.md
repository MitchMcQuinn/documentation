Mia from Future Tense is waiting for me to deliver a 1200 word piece on timekeeping. I wrote out a draft ([Future Tense - Lunar Timekeeping](../articles/Future%20Tense%20-%20Moon%20Time/Future%20Tense%20-%20Lunar%20Timekeeping.md)) and she commented on it here [Future Tense - Lunar Timekeeping - with edits](../articles/Future%20Tense%20-%20Lunar%20Timekeeping%20-%20with%20edits.md) -- we originally discussed this outline: [Future Tense - Lunar Timekeeping](../articles/Future%20Tense%20-%20Moon%20Time/Future%20Tense%20-%20Lunar%20Timekeeping.md)

I also discovered some Obsidian videos that show an interesting use case for "classes" that are like templates but with inheritance. https://youtu.be/yRt_9fDRd_A?si=5po38wk2wPkW1jsq 

Jacob asked me a week ago to comment on some ESA opportunities that we can use for the timekeeping effort... https://insidegnss.com/esa-wants-new-moon-missions-to-use-moonlight-pnt-services/
