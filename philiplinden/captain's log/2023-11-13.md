Met with [Erik van Winkle](../../MoonDAO/reference/Bios/external/Erik%20van%20Winkle.md) to talk about creating a Desci node for https://github.com/philiplinden/cremons-et-al-2022
- UI has a critical bug, not ready until next meeting (T+2w)
- The code as it is now is sufficient to demo the nodes
- One step further than a simple publish is to run the code on [Bacalhau]() and link the result id.
	- Bacalhau is a distributed compute service
	- Need to dockerize the code to run here
	- The job is sent to Bacalhau, and the result is sent back (no data/code needed on the host).
- There are a bunch of opportunities to write and publish a paper here on the process
	- IAC? Might fit in some of the sectionsâ€¦
	- Desci has some copy already to fill out intros, background, and fluff
