Apparently there's only $2k available, but this could be an interesting way to bring some funds to the MoonDAO treasury.
## LSIC
At a recent [LSIC](../../MoonDAO/reference/Orgs/Lunar%20Surface%20Innovation%20Consortium.md) PNT monthly call I discovered that there were 120+ applicants to the [LunA-10  - A Framework for Optimized, Integrated Lunar Infrastructure](../../MoonDAO/projects/lunar-comms/luna-10/LunA-10%20%20-%20A%20Framework%20for%20Optimized,%20Integrated%20Lunar%20Infrastructure.md) and only 30 were asked to submit a 10 pager. We were in the top 25%!!!!!!

There is also a lot of interest and support among LSIC attendees in decentralized / democratized approaches rather than one organization pitching a one-size-fits-all-does-everything service.

I spoke a bit about our "[CLOCSS](../../MoonDAO/projects/lunar-comms/luna-10/Cislunar%20Open%20Clock%20Synchronization%20System%20(CLOCSS).md)" concept at the meeting and caught the interest of some others looking to work with us, namely [[Marshall Eubanks]].
