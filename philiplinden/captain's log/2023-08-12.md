- I migrated all of the files in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ShhRGmpVNglUcu3RsECko_I97Xcm1yW_?usp=drive_link) to this vault.
	- The [[Network Topology Proposal]] and [[Research Notes]] were easy to import and clean up for Obsidian/markdown.
	- The [[Primer on Lunar Communications]] has been a pain because it has so many citations.
	- This work is tracked in dework by https://app.dework.xyz/moondao/lunar-comms?taskId=e31ba2e0-a411-4af2-98e6-e9df93704ee8
- I experimented with the [Citations](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-citation-plugin) and [Zotero Integration](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-zotero-desktop-connector) plugins to see which would be the most useful.
	- Citations is the easiest to use while writing by far. I mapped a hotkey to insert a citation from [[zotero.json]] and bam, ready to go.
	- Zotero Integration allows more granular control over what is included in the note and how the template is formatted.
	- Neither allow direct embedding of the PDF file though, so I went with Citations.
- I also created [[Home.canvas|Home]] as a homepage for the project. Not sure how to effectively use canvas yet.
- [[@pmoncada]] suggested doing a [[Reading List]] before the first meeting. Great idea.
- Finished migrating existing docs to Obsidian and submitted [dework task for review](https://app.dework.xyz/moondao/lunar-comms?taskId=e31ba2e0-a411-4af2-98e6-e9df93704ee8). Created [[Reading List]] and [dework task/subtasks](https://app.dework.xyz/moondao/lunar-comms?taskId=6e646842-811f-490d-93be-2e812974d1f9).
