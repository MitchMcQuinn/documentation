Zoom call: [@phil](../../MoonDAO/reference/Bios/@philiplinden.md) + [[Sean Casey]]

- no technical comments on luna-10 proposal
- what are the mission enabling use-cases
	- where's the wow
	- intuitive machines, etc
	- nokia ground based
	- assumed you need gps at the moon
	- what's the competition, what's the window of opportunity?
	- there's a lot of "dark fiber" that allows for open source
		- oversupply of software people!
		- dark fiber = unused capacity
		- not true for aerospace community
		- open source is a good way to downselect, then pull into company
	- open source is heavy on micromanagement
		- most successful teams were co-located "squads" ~5 people
		- asynchronous never worked
	- get student groups engaged to work together
- i'm saying grassroots effort means everyone can contribute
	- what's in it for me?
	- can you apply to a terrestrial market for the "helium" business model? "uber" model?
		- why didn't helium work?
- the big markets are on earth
	- can you build terrestrially and then transplant at the moon
	- is there a terrestrial version of landers?
		- reusable launch vehicles _are_ landers…
- I have to buy the cargo space, i have to take on the risk
	- we should do it, not build for others
	- we bolt on to others, pay for the cargo cost, and operate on their platform
		- get there and look for customers
	- buying cargo space == buying time on the moon
	- open source hardware still can apply, like time card – we operate working tech!
	- problem: getting in between lander business as a middleman, cuts into lander business
		- lander == base station (power, shelter, comms) for other missions → would the bolt-on system compete?
		- maybe we can collab with intuitive machines, ispace, astrobotic, spaceIL, etc
			- maybe we have a business case where the lander companies are the customers
- what are the use cases?
	- build the model around robotics (not human spaceflight)
- where's the wow?
	- why wouldn't intuitive machines go to nokia's 5G?

what to do
1. get permission from the family
	1. family are cofounders. 
	2. shit show by itself, don't want a shit show at home 
2. money == runway
	1. how long until you need to raise more money
		1. ex. 10m dollars does not mean build a lander for 10m
		2. it means 10m to build ip to earn more
	2. investment money is there to dig the hole, to build ip, to get the customers
	3. how to grow a company that has x dollars (given value:revenue ratio)
3. the first million is the hardest
	1. small team winning grants, doing work, build credibility
	2. moonlighting is a good way to get fired
	3. use proposal winnings and cred 
	4. look for incubators!
		1. UofR, RIT, Cornell
		2. Founder's Institute
			1. apply to the program
			2. graduate from program!
			3. usually take a stake of the company
	5. SBIRs
	6. Use this process to build the right team
		1. who is doing the work?
		2. is the team working efficiently?
		3. does everyone have the same buy-in?
		4. identify critical resources needed later on
			1. after founders, get cheap sales officer and finance officer
			2. need a good lawyer on the team!
CEO
1. raise money, find customers 
2. relations with investors & customers
CTO provides the "wow" that gets the idea to work
COO makes sure it's working
CFO what's our runway?
CSO builds the brand, makes sales inroads

mitigate risk, get customers → chicken, egg

harder to find a CEO that you trust and is committed… 
- investor that says "i'll be the CEO" → be careful! (example: Tesla)
- CEO can fire everyone else!
Be CEO, find a CTO.
- don't abdicate CEO right away until you find the right person
- if i want to be CTO, then i need to work for somebody

When is the right time to be a startup?
- Steve Blank "it's a project until you find a customer"
- It's not a company yet… but to apply for grants and proposals you need to be a company.
- Incubator can help navigate company structure nonsense so you don't need to redo it.
- LLC → profits not taxed twice, write off taxes… get legal advice
	- Small Business Administration (SBA) or tax preparers could help
	- "I need to create a business entity for tax purposes"
	- "How much time and money can everyone put in?"
		- cover legal expenses, taxes, fedex, etc
		- skin in the game
		- consider it a loan to the company, put it on the books as a liability
	- you want business expenses to come out of the business, not your pockets

Need to figure out:
- what is the business models? or possible business models?
- elizabeth holmes case study: i have something i want to do, how can i make that happen?
	- theranos = microfluidics + nanotech?
	- can these technologies apply to this problem?
	- opinion: investors didn't do due diligence

Bay area is pay to play!

In rochester, find the incubator people.
- i'm working on this project
- i can bring in some money from proposals
- i'd like to grow this into a company
- can you help me do that?
	- financial help
	- legal advice
	- startup advice
- show that we have a technical team that has been working together to do business
	- show that the core team has a track record
- gotta be a player, gotta be in the game
	- identify proposal opps, make good on them
		- SBIR
		- STTR
		- Mason Peck @ Cornell
			- go for it! meet up
license IP?

Be the CEO.
1. get permission from home, keep the wife happy
2. get permission from day job, keep the boss happy (or keep it under the radar)
3. find people + delegate work
4. mitigate all risks before going all-in

TODO
1. Get in an upstate NY incubator program
2. Get in touch with Founder's Institute
3. Identify proposals, build technical team around proposals
4. Don't get fired from day job
5. Distill a business case

Time frame: 
- if i spent first third of 2024 working on pitch (4 months)
	- get the story straight
	- build the team
	- who are the investors we want to talk to?
	- meet with potential customers
- second third pitching (4 months)
	- introduce to investors, build cred
		- like 5x conversations per week
		- who is our suiter?
	- talk to potential customers
- third close a funding round by the end of the year
	- they'll be investing in the _team_ – need to show a good track record
	- put a ring on the finger

It should take about 4 months to prepare a pitch.
Should be happy with co-founders as much as happy with wife – startups are like marriages.
