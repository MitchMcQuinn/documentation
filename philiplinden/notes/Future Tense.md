- Mia Armstrong-Lopez asked me to write a 1200 word piece on my fellowship whitepaper back in july
	- [Future Tense - Lunar Timekeeping](../articles/Future%20Tense%20-%20Moon%20Time/Future%20Tense%20-%20Lunar%20Timekeeping.md)
- Recently (after my months-long radio silence) she offered $350 to complete the article
	- My draft [Future Tense - Lunar Timekeeping](../articles/Future%20Tense%20-%20Moon%20Time/Future%20Tense%20-%20Lunar%20Timekeeping.md)
	- With feedback [Future Tense - Lunar Timekeeping - with edits](../articles/Future%20Tense%20-%20Lunar%20Timekeeping%20-%20with%20edits.md)
		- > Finally, we cite sources via hyperlinks, rather than footnotes, if you wouldn't mind migrating some of the footnotes (I'm happy to help with that as well). And some of the links led to something called Zotero, which didn't allow me to access the information - not sure if that's fixable?

# Moon Time
## Longform Project
- [Future Tense - Moon Time](../articles/Future%20Tense%20-%20Moon%20Time/Future%20Tense%20-%20Moon%20Time.md)

## Outline
- Lead with the example of the two satellites coming close to each other, explaining that the problem was they were both using different time measurements
- Have a statement on how this is an illustration of a problem that is going to get worse, as the moon gets more crowded
- Transition into a paragraph saying luckily we know how to solve that: agreeing on a unified time system, it's something we've done before on Earth
- Explain how space agencies are already interested in this/recognize the need - explain the line from the interoperability agreements
- Explain how that line sent you down a research rabbit hole of how this could be done - and then transition into what you found: 

- Outline, briefly, how it could be done, what would be needed
- Explain, briefly, some of the sticky questions we need to resolve - what would this look like? Would there be different time zones? Give examples/analogies if possible

- Close on a strong statement about why this needs to happen now - we have the tools!

The tone we aim for is a conversation with a smart friend who is not an expert in this topic - giving analogies and concrete examples, and trying to avoid (or at least define) technical terms. Also, we use hyperlinks to cite sources/if there's anything you want to direct people out to. And if we could aim to stick to around 1200 words, that would be great - the goal is not to be comprehensive, but rather to give people a taste for the general lay of the land. Though if you go over that be a couple hundred words it's not the end of the world - we can always cut in editing.
