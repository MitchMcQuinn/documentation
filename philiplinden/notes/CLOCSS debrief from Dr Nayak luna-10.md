admin notes
    this is not a formal debrief
    cannot talk about other responses
    some questions cant answe...

data rights, team teaming
    no significant weaknesses
    nda, ip posture ok

team teaming
    ok
    breadth and depth+experience was great
    multidisc were resourced at enough level (this was important)

metrics
    metrics as defined were great
    is this iterative or revolutionary?
    well defined, suitably aggressive, potentially achievable

technical rationale
    strengths
        interesting 
        good job spelling out precision
        good enough timing and ranging precision
        single component, cots
        open source architecture
        well suited for low grav
        independent from earth based timing
        naturally resilient, mixed mode
        order of magnitude calcs look reasonable, well done

not a good fit for luna10 specific objectives
    looking for multi service integrated concepts
    hub for multiple services from same hub, technically & economically
    this was seen as a single-application tech, narrowly scoped
    how much advancement over state of the art?
    what potential could it unlock?
    ground the metrics against state of the art (how many x improvement?)

economic analysis includes cislunar economy, but not clear how it taps into
that markey
    how would it close business case
    who is the market, how would they pay -> first order estimate
    how it integrates into other platforms

    proposal did not contain concept of operations for how it would integrate
    into an existing tech
        power impact?
        service agreements?

solid technical strengths and metrics

decentralized nature and open sourceness were very positive aspects

we wrote a great proposal, but it was a single economic case -- not a good fit
for luna-10 but not a bad proposal.
