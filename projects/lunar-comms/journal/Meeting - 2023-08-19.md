# Notes
### catch up
[[@pmoncada]]
- published a "master plan"
- playing with obsidian canvases thinking through logical flows, mind maps, etc
[[@gregsearch]]
- read some papers, made some notes on dework
- some ideation and notes and "musings"
-  _need to put things in obsidian!_
[[@philiplinden]]
- Made notes from [[Meeting - 2023-08-15]]
- Added pdfs to [[Reading List]] items
- "evangelizing"
	- [[DARPA - A Framework for Optimized, Integrated Lunar Infrastructure]]
	- [[captain's log#2023-08-18]] 

### today
- [[NASA NextSTEP-2 BAA]] opp is gone and [[DARPA - A Framework for Optimized, Integrated Lunar Infrastructure|DARPA]] one is here – even if we don't _actually_ apply, these help us structure our deliverables and organize our research
	- our research goals stay the same here
	- note that darpa and nasa's goals are usually not the same!
		- darpa seeks to fail fast, iterate, learn. if things "fail", they are usually shelved and saved later
		- nasa seeks a durable, working system
- [[DePrize.canvas|DePrize]] overview from [[@pmoncada]]
	- tries to make economic incentive to work fast and productively, while still retaining decentralized ethos. also hopes to sustain moondao long term
	- lunar comms is a great candidate for deprize, so is lunar settlement, isru etc
	- This could also be the start of having crypto outpace govt grants, especially for historically underfunded areas.
	- Lunar comms is poised to be a guinea pig for the first deprize while the structure is being refined
	- Adapt existing, proven mechanisms (that have integrity and lessons baked in) to crypto
	- Failed/losing projects – can they live on chain to support later work?
		- with up front funding (half now, half winner) the research is still rewarded
		- do funders still retain a stake in the submissions they voted for?
	- The "credibly neutral judge" could (should) be a smart contract or program that determines the winner based on pass/fail criteria
		- Whether the judge is a committee of humans or a program depends on the prize
		- darpa-like to catalyze capabilities — nebulous, not easily quantifiable or boiled down to pass/fail criteria
		- nasa-like to meet mission requirements — easily converted to pass/fail criteria
- [[@greg]] Lots of new people, new ideas, new systems, etc… how do we bridge the gap?
	1. do the darpa proposal
	2. go back and pretend we submitted it to deprize first and see how things play out
	3. use the darpa thing as a baseline/reference to tune the deprize process
# Action items
- [ ] [[@philiplinden]] get interested parties (us, Ramon, Ahmad, Ramon's phd student from cornell, jacob from open lunar, chris rabotin) in the same room to talk about [[DARPA - A Framework for Optimized, Integrated Lunar Infrastructure]]
