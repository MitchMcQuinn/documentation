## objectives/interests for our special sauce
- credible neutrality among adversarial actors
- open and permissionless - can't refuse service. what happens?
- how does the assumptions of decentralized actors impacts the effectiveness of different topologies
- take inspiration from spam mitigation
	- use fees as an inhibitor
	- web3 gas auctions?
	- have servers earn tokens, and use gas to send and receive (in mooney)
		- larger servers have more influence in mooney because they have more influence in the system governed by it!
